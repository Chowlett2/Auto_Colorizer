# Auto_Colorizer

This project's aim is to colorize grayscale images through the help of convolutional autoencoders.
Primarily, we are concerned with colorizing indoor scenes.
The images used for training/val/test are from the MIT Indoor Scenes dataset.

## Usage/Examples

The data can be downloaded from Kaggle using this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/itsahmad/indoor-scenes-cvpr-2019).

The script for the [project](https://github.com/Chowlett2/Auto_Colorizer/blob/main/model.ipynb) is usable with some changes to file directory on your system.

Pre-trained model weights from this project are located [here](https://github.com/Chowlett2/Auto_Colorizer/blob/main/model-epoch-20-losses-0.003.pth).
